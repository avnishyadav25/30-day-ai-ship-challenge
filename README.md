# 30-Day Ship Challenge

## Purpose
This 30-day challenge is about building the habit of shipping real work in public, every day.

The goal is not perfection or viral content — it’s to create systems that remove decision fatigue, enforce accountability, and turn ideas into tangible outputs.

By shipping consistently (code, automations, content, and learnings), I’m proving that progress comes from systems and execution, not motivation.

At the end of 30 days, I should have reusable workflows, documented builds, and a clear operating system I can repeat for any future project.

## Structure
- [**Live Tracker (Google Sheet)**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g0DzsFKLDq9Ke13c_1DlGOIPyXUMk3fjPjLywOMZmjk/edit?usp=sharing)
- `tracker/`: Progress tracking systems (checklists, logs)
- `builds/`: Daily outputs (code, docs, assets)
- `templates/`: Reusable starters for workflows and agents

## Naming Convention
Every file follows: `YYYY-MM-DD_platform_content-type_topic`
Example: `2025-04-10_x_thread_30day-kickoff`

## Guardrail Rules
More importantly, I wrote down what I won't post. These are my guardrail rules:
- No vague motivational content without concrete steps
- No promises of "overnight results" or "secret hacks"
- No content about tools I haven't personally used in the challenge
- No engagement bait that doesn't deliver real value
